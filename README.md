Hello, Shibes

New is the QuatroShibe 3/4 multisig wallet (and other x/4 multisig options).

There's the instruction manual for TripleShibe. Currently six translations and counting.

This site contains two wallets but can really be thought of being a tool for working with multisigs. You can use this site to:

  Create Dogecoin Addresses,or Dogecoin Multisig Addresses, online or offline.

  Spend From Dogecoin Addresses (regular or multisig).

  Access Unspent Transactions. Sign Transactions offline (and Broadcast them online).
    
  Create your own QR codes and other miscellaneous tools.

  and much more.

You keep the Private Keys to yourself. This program is written in Javascript, meaning all computations are performed by your browser (allowing for offline use), so the private keys stay on the your (the client) side.

There are three primary wallets contained within this site:

The "Dogecoin Bankings Suite", or DBS, wallet utilizes two public keys and yields six Dogecoin Addresses, and these are organized with names like "Personal 1", "Checking Account", "Savings Account".

The "TripleShibe" wallet utilizes three public keys, featuring an interface for a single 2/3 Dogecoin Multisig. There is also a small 'more' button that opens the remainder of the TripleShibe interface, which includes several more addresses and three DBS accounts. Three public keys put together in this fashion, they're pretty powerful, see..

The "QuatroShibe" wallet is a 4-public key wallet, enabling a 3/4 Dogecoin Multisig, and 2/4, 1/4, etc.

All sites have a so-called 'Pay Spot' button, these in turn have 'Reddit' buttons that utilize the search capability of reddit for organizational purposes. Here's an example leveraging this capability for a charitable endeavor: http://dogecoinmultisig.org/multisigmain/index.html?payspot=9vnaTWu71XWimFCW3hctSxryQgYg7rRZ7y#payspot


The entire site is turnkey and can be run offline as well... you can copy it to a memory stick and run index.html.
